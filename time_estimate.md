  PROJECT TIME ESTIMATION & BREAKDOWN
======================================================================

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & First ETL Pipeline (Approx. 3-5 hours)
*This phase covers the foundational work of setting up a professional environment.*
- **Environment Setup:** Configuring Google Colab and connecting to the Neon PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Gathering:** Manually downloading over a dozen separate raw data files from the source.
- **First ETL Script:** Writing the initial Python code to process, transform, and load the data into the database. This includes the first (flawed) attempt at parsing the timestamps.

---

### Phase 2: The "Debugging Deep Dive" - The Most Time-Intensive Phase (Approx. 10-15 hours)
*This is where the real-world problem-solving happened. This phase demonstrates resilience and strong analytical skills.*
- **Solving the "Disappearing Data" Mystery:**
  - **Problem:** Data was being dropped after January 9th of each year.
  - **Process:** Involved multiple rounds of diagnostic queries, examining raw data, and pinpointing the root cause: an incorrect format string in the `pd.to_datetime` function that failed on double-digit hours.
  - **Solution:** Rewriting and re-running the entire ETL pipeline with a more robust timestamp creation method.

- **Solving the "Impossible Daily Counts" Mystery:**
  - **Problem:** Queries were returning nonsensical results like 31,700 "hourly" observations in a single day.
  - **Process:** This required a deep investigation. We tested and disproved several theories (grouping errors, SUM vs. COUNT) before a targeted query proved that the database contained **duplicate hourly entries**, likely from an error in the initial data ingestion.
  - **Solution:** Correcting the SQL queries to count only unique timestamps (`COUNT(DISTINCT m.ts)`), which finally yielded logical results.

### Phase 3: The "Legal Compliance" Pivot (Approx. 4-6 hours)
*This phase shows your ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge and adapt your methodology.*
- **Research:** Finding and interpreting the specific Chilean environmental laws (`Decreto Supremo`) that govern data validation.
- **Methodology Shift:** Realizing that a simple average was not enough. You had to rebuild the analysis to be based on "legally compliant" days (>=18 hours of data).
- **Key Analytical Insight:** Discovering that while you had thousands of compliant *days*, the data was too sparse to create compliant *months* or *years*. This shifted the entire narrative of the project's final report.

---

### Phase 4: Final Analysis, Modeling, and Visualization (Approx. 5-8 hours)
*With clean data, this phase focused on generating the final insights and products.*
- **Statistical Modeling:** Preparing the data for regression (one-hot encoding), building the `statsmodels` OLS model, and, most importantly, **interpreting the complex summary table** to isolate the weather's impact from the pandemic's.
- **Visualization:** Creating the final plots. This was an iterative process of refining aesthetics, correcting misleading axes (`matplotlib.dates`), and ensuring the charts were clear and professional.
- **Report Writing:** Drafting the final bilingual `README` files, structuring the findings, and telling the compelling story of the project's evolution.

---

### Phase 5: Professional Packaging for GitHub (Approx. 2-3 hours)
*This is the final step of turning the analysis into a polished portfolio piece.*
- **File Organization:** Creating the clean folder structure (`notebooks`, `sql`, `data`, `imgs`).
- **SQL Documentation:** Writing the `schema.sql`, `consultas_base.sql`, and `consultas_solucion.sql` files.
- **GitHub Management:** Uploading the project, editing the `README.md` files, and ensuring all links (like the "Open in Colab" badge) were correct.
